I am a Software Engineer, expertise as a Backend Developer, I dibble dabble around tech tracks before finally coming to terms with backend development.

I'm the current Google Developer Student Clubs Lead in the Federal University Of Oye and I develop an affinity for opensource contributions.

I love security and tried developing a career in it which lead to me having skill in python and hence my transitioning to backend development, I like python as a language but i love building APIs and developing backend service more with simplicity and use of logic.
