I'm a Penetration tester and an aspiring Security Analyst, formerly a Frontend developer before moving back to infosec.

I am new to GO lang, but back in my Frontend Dev career am a very Big Fan of javascript, most especially Vuejs, which is a javascript framework, i develpoed my interest back in InfoSec because thats where i came from, i love working more on terminal and mostly Web applications, someday i will look into Android Pentesting and Security.
